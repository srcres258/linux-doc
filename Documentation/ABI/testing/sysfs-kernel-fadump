Description:	read only
		The Kdump scripts utilize udev rules to monitor memory add/remove
		events, ensuring that FADUMP is automatically re-registered when
		system memory changes occur. This re-registration was necessary
		to update the elfcorehdr, which describes the system memory to the
		second kernel. Now If this sysfs node holds a value of 1, it
		indicates to userspace that FADUMP does not require re-registration
		since the elfcorehdr is now generated in the second kernel.
